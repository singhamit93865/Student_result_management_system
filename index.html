            <p>The DAV Public school (Dayanand Anglo vedic) is one of the oldest and premier schools in India. In 1885, the first DAV School was established at Lahore which was subsequently upgraded to become the first DAV College. In 1886 the DAV College Trust and Management Society was established and registered. It is a non-governmental educational organisation in India and overseas with over 900 schools, 75 colleges and a university. It is based on the ideals of Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati. Full Form of DAV is Dayanand Anglo Vedic. The Dayanand Anglo-Vedic education system also comprises colleges offering graduate and post-graduate degrees in areas of study all over India. English is the primary language of instruction, with students also receiving compulsory education in Hindi and Sanskrit or a regional language. The DAV movement has grown to become the single largest non-governmental educational society in the country, managing 750+ educational institutions, apart from D.A.V. Public Schools spread over the country and even in foreign lands, with an annual budget of more than INR â‚¹2 billion. It employs 50,000+ people and educates more than 20 lakh students every year. </p>
